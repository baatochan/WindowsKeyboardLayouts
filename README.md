# Windows Keyboard Layouts
Few keyboard layouts for Windows, mostly created by me.

Layouts available:

* Polish (Programmers) - Baatochan  
	My custom layout that I use on my daily driver. It adds `ƒÅ`, frees up '\' key, etc.
* AltLatin  
	Perfect layout that allows entering almost every Latin character. I'm not an author.
